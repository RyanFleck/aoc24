This year I am taking on the challenges in **Clojure**.

To use, add a `profiles.clj` file with the following data:

```clojure
{:dev {:env {:aoc-session "53616c7... "}}}
```

You'll need to step through and execute (`C-x C-e`) most of the
solutions step by step with a REPL.

```clojure
(comment
  (= 2 (count-trues (map is-level-safe? (str->matrix sample)))) ; test case
  (count-trues (map is-level-safe? (str->matrix input)))) ; correct!
```
